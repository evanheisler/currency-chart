# Currency Chart

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. I did so to take advantage of best-in-class tools without spending too much time on webpack, etc.

I added a few Storybook components as well for examples of UI testing.

The project uses Redux for a data store.

## Getting Started

`yarn && yarn start`
